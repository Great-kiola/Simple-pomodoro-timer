# Simple-pomodoro-timer
This is a simple pomodoro timer, that is used to count the time for the user, The pomodoro technique involves a 25 minutes work and 5 minutes break.

## Challenges Faced
- Making the buttons work by making them do what they are intended to do, like the pause button to pause the timer, the play button to continue from where the user stopped and the reset button, to reset the countdown back to zero.
- I also faced a challenge of making the button align properly like it should

## Further improvements
- There are further improvements that can be made
- Allow the user to be able to select a time they want. i.e 5 Minutes which sets the timer automatically to 5minutes
- I tried to add a sound to when the countdown reaches 0, a sound is made to inform the user that the countdown ended

## Acheivements
- Making it work
- Was able to making the flip actually flip
